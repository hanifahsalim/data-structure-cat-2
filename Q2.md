Memory Allocation: Arrays are static data structures with fixed memory allocation, meaning their size must be known in advance. This can lead to inefficient memory usage if the allocated size does not match the actual data requirements. In contrast, linked lists are dynamic data structures that allow for memory expansion, as memory is allocated for each node as needed during runtime.

Performance: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for fast access to elements via direct indexing. However, insertion and deletion operations in arrays are complicated and time-consuming, as they require shifting elements to maintain order. Linked lists, while not supporting direct indexing and thus having slower access times, allow for more efficient insertion and deletion operations by adjusting pointers without the need for shifting elements.

Insertion and Deletion Operations: In arrays, inserting or deleting elements necessitates shifting subsequent elements to maintain order, leading to higher time complexity. Linked lists facilitate more efficient insertion and deletion by adjusting node pointers, eliminating the need for shiftingÂ elements.
