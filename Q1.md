1.Ignore Constants
Drop constant factors and lower-order terms.
 O(2n) → O(n)


2.Focus on the Dominant Term
Keep the term with the highest growth rate.
O(n² + n) → O(n²)

3.Iterative Loops
Single loop → O(n)
Nested loops → Multiply complexities → O(n × n) = O(n²)

4.Consecutive Operations Add
Add complexities, then simplify.
O(n) + O(n²) → O(n²)

5.Recursive Calls 
Dividing input  → O(log n)
 Binary Search → O(log n)
